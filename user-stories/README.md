# User Stories Documentation

This directory contains user stories derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone backend system. Each story describes a key interaction between a user (guest, host, or admin) and the system, helping to define the functional requirements of the backend.

## Purpose

User stories are an essential part of agile development. They help developers and stakeholders understand what features are important and how users are expected to interact with the system.

## Contents

- `user-stories.md`: A collection of user stories capturing the most critical functionalities of the system such as user registration, property listings, booking management, payments, reviews, and messaging.

## How to Use

These user stories should serve as a reference when implementing backend features. They are meant to guide the development process and ensure that user needs are accurately addressed in the final system.

## Related Tasks
